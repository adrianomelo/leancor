# Reasoner configuration file.
# Lines starting with '#' are interpreted as comments (like this line).
# Each non-comment line starts with a key followed by one or more values. 
# All values must be separated by tabs (i.e., by the character '	').

# The official name of the reasoner.
ReasonerName	leancor

# The output sub-directory in the 'responses' folder, must not contain characters that are not allowed for paths/files.
OutputPathName	leancor

# The starter script that is executed to start the reasoner, must be executable!
StarterScript	RELATIVETOSOURCEDIRECTORY	./execReasoner.sh

# The working directory for the reasoner process. It should not be necessary to change this.
WorkingDirectory	RELATIVETOSOURCEDIRECTORY	./

# The used interface for the reasoner, must be 'OREV2' for the ORE 2014 competition.
InterfaceType	OREV2

# The ontology serialisation format that is required by the reasoner.
# Must be:
# - 'OWL2XML' (for the OWL 2 XML serialisation format <http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-syntax-20121211/>), or
# - 'OWL2FUNCTIONAL' (for the OWL 2 Functional Style serialisation format <http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-xml-serialization-20121211/>), or
# - 'RDFXML' (for the RDF/XML mapping of OWL 2, <http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-mapping-to-rdf-20121211/>), or
# - 'ANY' (if the reasoner supports all ontology serialisation formats, e.g., by using the OWL API).
# Note that the evaluation framework automatically converts the ontologies into the required format (except for the 'ANY' configuration, where the original ontologies are directly used).
OntologyFormatType	OWL2FUNCTIONAL

# The OWL 2 Profiles that are supported by the reasoner.
# The specified profiles must be separated by tabs, e.g., if the reasoner supports EL and RL, then the following line can be used:
# ProfileSupport	EL	RL
# The evaluation framework reports errors if the reasoner calculates unexpected results for ontologies in supported profiles.
ProfileSupport	EL

# Specifies whether the reasoner supports the OWL 2 datatypes.
DatatypeSupport	FALSE

# Specifies whether the reasoner supports DL-safe/SWRL rules.
RuleSupport	FALSE
